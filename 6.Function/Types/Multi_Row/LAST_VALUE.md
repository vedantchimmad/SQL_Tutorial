# üîö SQL Window Function: LAST_VALUE()

---
### üìò What is LAST_VALUE()?

The `LAST_VALUE()` function returns the **last value** in an ordered window (partition) of rows. It's useful to compare every row in a group to the **last value** of that group.

### üßæ Syntax

```roomsql
SELECT column1, column2,
       LAST_VALUE(target_column)
       OVER (
         PARTITION BY partition_column 
         ORDER BY sort_column 
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
       ) AS last_val
FROM table_name;
```
> üîÅ ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING is often required to ensure the window includes the full partition.
