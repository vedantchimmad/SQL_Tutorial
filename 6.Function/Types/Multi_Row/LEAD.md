# üîÑ SQL Window Function: LEAD()

---
### üìò What is LEAD()?

The `LEAD()` function gives access to a **subsequent row's value** from the current row within the result set, based on the specified `ORDER BY`. It is commonly used to compare **current and next row values**.

### üßæ Syntax

```roomsql
SELECT column1, column2,
       LEAD(target_column, offset, default_value)
       OVER (PARTITION BY partition_column ORDER BY sort_column) AS next_value
FROM table_name;
```
* `target_column`: The column to pull the future value from.
* `offset`: (Optional) How many rows forward to look. Default is 1.
* `default_value`: (Optional) What to return if there is no next row. Default is NULL.
