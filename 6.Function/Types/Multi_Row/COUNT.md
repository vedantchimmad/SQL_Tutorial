# ðŸ”¢ SQL Window Function: COUNT()

---
### ðŸ“˜ What is COUNT() as a Window Function?

The `COUNT()` window function returns the **number of rows** in the current window frame. Unlike `GROUP BY`, it doesnâ€™t reduce the number of rows â€” it just adds a count value per row based on the window.

### ðŸ§¾ Syntax

```roomsql
SELECT column1, column2,
       COUNT(column_name) OVER (
           [PARTITION BY partition_column]
           [ORDER BY order_column]
           [ROWS BETWEEN frame_start AND frame_end]
       ) AS count_output
FROM table_name;
```

### ðŸ§ª Sample Table: employee
| id | name  | dept  | salary |
| -- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| 1  | Alice | HR    | 60000  |
| 2  | Bob   | HR    | 50000  |
| 3  | Carol | Sales | 70000  |
| 4  | Dave  | Sales | 72000  |
| 5  | Eve   | Sales | 71000  |

#### âœ… Example: Row Count per Department
```roomsql
SELECT name, dept, salary,
       COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY dept) AS dept_count
FROM employee;
```
### ðŸ“¤ Output
| name  | dept  | salary | dept\_count |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| Alice | HR    | 60000  | 2           |
| Bob   | HR    | 50000  | 2           |
| Carol | Sales | 70000  | 3           |
| Dave  | Sales | 72000  | 3           |
| Eve   | Sales | 71000  | 3           |

### ðŸ’¡ Notes
* `PARTITION BY` dept calculates the count within each department.
* `COUNT(*)` counts all rows, even if columns contain NULLs.
* If you use `COUNT(column_name)`, it excludes NULLs from that column.
