# ðŸ§® GROUP BY in SQL

---
### ðŸ“˜ What is `GROUP BY`?

The `GROUP BY` clause in SQL is used to **group rows** that have the same values in specified columns.  
Itâ€™s often used with **aggregate functions** like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()` to perform **calculations on grouped data**.


### ðŸ§¾ Syntax

```roomsql
SELECT column1, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
```
### ðŸ§® Common Aggregate Functions

| Function     | Description                | Example Use                        |
|--------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `COUNT()`    | Counts the number of rows  | Count employees in each department |
| `SUM()`      | Adds up values             | Total salary per department        |
| `AVG()`      | Calculates the average     | Average salary per department      |
| `MAX()`      | Finds the highest value    | Highest salary in each department  |
| `MIN()`      | Finds the lowest value     | Lowest salary in each department   |

### ðŸ“Š Example Table: employees
| id   | name   | department | salary |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| 1    | Alice  | HR         | 60000  |
| 2    | Bob    | IT         | 75000  |
| 3    | Carol  | IT         | 65000  |
| 4    | Dave   | HR         | 62000  |

### ðŸ”§ Common Use Cases

#### 1. Total Salary by Department
```roomsql
SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```
#### 2. Count of Employees in Each Department
```roomsql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```
#### 3. Average Salary by Department
```roomsql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```
#### 4.GROUP BY with HAVING (Filter Groups)
```roomsql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 65000;
```
### âœ… Example with Everything
```roomsql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS count, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 60000
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
ORDER BY avg_sal DESC;
```
## ðŸ“š Rules for Using `GROUP BY` in SQL
| Rule | Rule Description                                                    |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | All non-aggregated columns in SELECT must be in GROUP BY            |
| 2    | GROUP BY comes after WHERE and before ORDER BY                      |
| 3    | You can group by multiple columns                                   |
| 4    | Use HAVING (not WHERE) to filter grouped data                       |
| 5    | Cannot use column aliases in GROUP BY, but can use them in ORDER BY |
| 6    | NULL values are grouped together                                    |
| 7    | Use aggregates with compatible data types                           |
