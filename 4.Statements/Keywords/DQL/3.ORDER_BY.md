# ðŸ”¢ ORDER BY in SQL

---
### ðŸ“˜ What is `ORDER BY`?

The `ORDER BY` **clause** in SQL is used to **sort the result set** of a `SELECT` query by one or more columns, either in **ascending (`ASC`)** or **descending (`DESC`)** order.

* **ASC** (default): Ascending order (smallest â†’ largest, A â†’ Z)
* **DESC**: Descending order (largest â†’ smallest, Z â†’ A)

### ðŸ§¾ Syntax

```roomsql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;
```

### ðŸ“Š Example Table: employees
| id | name  | department | salary |
| -- | ----- | ---------- | ------ |
| 1  | Alice | HR         | 60000  |
| 2  | Bob   | IT         | 75000  |
| 3  | Carol | IT         | 65000  |
