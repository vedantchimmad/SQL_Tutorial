# üìå `HAVING` Clause in SQL

---
## üìò What is `HAVING`?

The `HAVING` clause in SQL is used to **filter groups** created by the `GROUP BY` clause.  
Unlike `WHERE`, which filters rows **before** grouping, `HAVING` filters the **aggregated results**.

### üîÅ Syntax

```roomsql
SELECT column1, AGG_FUNC(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING condition;
```

## üßæ Example Table: employees
| id | name  | department | salary |
| -- | ----- | ---------- | ------ |
| 1  | Alice | HR         | 60000  |
| 2  | Bob   | IT         | 75000  |
| 3  | Carol | IT         | 65000  |
| 4  | Dave  | HR         | 62000  |
| 5  | Erin  | Sales      | 58000  |

### üîß Common Use Cases

#### 1. Average Salary > 60000
```roomsql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;
```
#### 2.Example Using where
```roomsql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 58000
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;
```
